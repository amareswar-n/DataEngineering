*This roadmap guides you from beginner to senior data engineer in clear phases, based on real industry experience and hiring expectations.*

## 🧭 **Exploration** <sub>*.. clarity not any skill* </sub>
Before learning anything. Make sure you understand the role clearly so you know what you’re signing up for before investing your time and effort.

**Data engineering**, is not not about flashy visuals, dashboards or charts — it’s about systems, pipelines, fixing issues, and working behind the scenes. 
It’s about <b>building the data foundation</b> that everything else depends on.

As a data engineer, your job is to:

- Move data between systems
- Clean messy, unreliable data
- Build pipelines that run every day
- Fix things when they break

Your work is often invisible, but when data is wrong or missing, everyone feels it. This role is less about writing perfect code and more about solving real data problems. 
You’ll debug frequently, investigate failures, and learn how data systems behave in the real world.

### ⚖️Decide is data engineering right for you?<br>

  - [ ]  “**Yes** — this feels right. I want to commit and learn it properly.”
  - [ ]  “**No** — this isn’t for me, and that’s okay.”
    
*Choose one that matters most and be honest with yourself. Ignore hype and salary — ask whether you would genuinely enjoy doing this work every week.*

## 🏗️ **Foundations** <sub>*.. the building blocks*</sub>
We’re building your expertise from the ground up so that working with code and data feels like a second language. This stage isn’t about rushing—it’s about mastering the essentials through deliberate practice and deep understanding.

# 🏗️ Data Engineering Fundamentals Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to build core data engineering skills step-by-step. The goal is to move beyond "rushing through tutorials" and instead focus on **genuine effort and deep understanding** so that working with data and code feels natural.

📅 Estimated Timeline: ~6–9 Months (Deep Dive)
*Note: Progress depends on prior experience and weekly time commitment. Quality of understanding > Speed of completion.*

## 🚀 The "End Game" Capstone Project
To graduate from this roadmap, build a single project that integrates these skills:

1. **Extraction:** Scrape a public API using **Python** (e.g., Weather or Finance data).
2. **Containerization:** Wrap your scraper in a **Docker** container.
3. **Storage:** Land the raw data in a **Cloud Bucket** (S3/GCS) in **JSON** format.
4. **Transformation:** Use **SQL** or **Spark** to clean the data and convert it to **Parquet**.
5. **Modeling:** Load it into a **Lakehouse** using a Star Schema.
6. **Orchestration:** Schedule the whole flow using **Airflow**.
7. **Reliability:** Implement **Data Quality** checks (e.g., Great Expectations) and **Logging**.

---

## 📖 How to use this 
1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Mark your progress by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
3. Commit your notes or small practice scripts to this repo as you learn.
4. **Master the foundations:** Don't move to Spark until your SQL is solid. Don't move to Airflow until your Python is clean.
