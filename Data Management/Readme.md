# Data Management 

**Data management** is the organizational practice of collecting, organizing, architecting, governing, processing and maintaining data securely and effectively so it can be used for business analytics and decision-making.

Increasingly, data management is increasingly concerned with making data ‘AI-ready’—high-quality, accessible, and trusted for training artificial intelligence (AI ) models. A recent survey by industry analyst Gartner found that 63 percent of organizations feel they don’t have, or aren’t sure they have, the right data management practices in place for AI.1

Data management strategy helps organizations ensure that data is always available, integrated, governed, secure and accurate. It forms a foundation for digital transformation, AI initiatives and better business outcomes.
A complete data management strategy accounts for various factors, including how to:

- Collect, integrate and store data from diverse sources—including structured and unstructured data—and from across hybrid and multiple clouds.

- Maintain high-availability, resiliency and disaster recovery of data stored across multiple locations.

- Build or obtain fit-for-purpose databases to meet a variety of workload and price-performance needs.

- Help ensure sharing of business data and metadata across organizations, to enable greater self-service, collaboration and access to data.

- Secure and govern data, while helping meet compliance requirements and meeting data privacy requirements.

- Manage the data lifecycle from creation to deletion with end-to-end integration, governance, lineage, observability and master data management (MDM).

- Automate data discovery and analysis with generative AI for data management.

Data
In essence, data is any collection of facts, numbers, words, observations or other useful information. But data comes in many different forms, each defined by its unique characteristics, sources and formats.

Learn more 
Databases
There’s a database for virtually every data management or data processing application. Explore relational databases, vector databases, distributed databases, query engines—they’re all here.

Learn more 
Data platforms
Data platforms—including data warehouses, data lakes and data lakehouses—enable collection, transformation, analysis and governance of data for specific tasks.

Learn more 
Data architecture
Data architectures describe how data is managed—from collection through consumption—and set the blueprint for how it flows through the organization. They’re also foundational to data processing operations and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.

Data engineering
Data engineers design systems for the aggregation, storage and analysis of data at scale, and empower organizations to get insights in real time from large datasets.

Data transfer
Explore ways to move digital information between systems, devices and locations, including file transfer, data streaming and data migration.

Learn more 
Data integration
Data integration brings together data from disparate sources, transforming it into a consistent structure and making it accessible for processing, analysis and decision making.

Learn more 
Data processing
Data processing is the conversion of raw data into usable information through structured steps such as data collection, preparation, analysis and storage. Today, machine learning (ML), AI and parallel processing—or parallel computing—enable large-scale data processing.

Learn more 
Big data
Big data encompasses massive, complex datasets in various formats, including structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, that demand advanced analytical approache for extracting meaningful insights.

Enterprise data management
Enterprise data management (EDM) is data management at scale—organizing, governing and optimizing enterprize data throughout its lifecycle, from creation and collection to storage, integration, usage and eventual archiving or disposal.

Data quality
Data quality measures how well a dataset meets criteria for accuracy, completeness, validity, consistency, uniqueness, timeliness and fitness for purpose. It’s critical to all data governance initiatives within an organization.

Data governance
Data governance helps ensure data availability, security, and integrity by defining and implementing policies, standards and procedures for data collection, ownership, storage, processing and use.
