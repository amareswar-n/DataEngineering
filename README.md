*This roadmap guides you from beginner to senior data engineer in clear phases, based on real industry experience and hiring expectations.*

## 🧭 **Exploration** <sub>*.. clarity not any skill* </sub>

<details open>
<summary> Before learning anything. Make sure you understand the role clearly so you know what you’re signing up for before investing your time and effort.</summary>
<br>
  
**Data engineering**, is not not about flashy visuals, dashboards or charts — it’s about systems, pipelines, fixing issues, and working behind the scenes. 
It’s about <b>building the data foundation</b> that everything else depends on.

As a data engineer, your job is to:

- Move data between systems
- Clean messy, unreliable data
- Build pipelines that run every day
- Fix things when they break

Your work is often invisible, but when data is wrong or missing, everyone feels it. This role is less about writing perfect code and more about solving real data problems. 
You’ll debug frequently, investigate failures, and learn how data systems behave in the real world.

### 📈 Maturity Ladder

| Level | Focus |
|------|------|
| Junior | Pipelines, SQL, debugging |
| Mid | Distributed systems, cloud, orchestration |
| Senior | Architecture, reliability, cost optimisation |
| Staff | Platform design, governance, strategy 

### ⚖️Decide is data engineering right for you?<br>

  - [ ]  “**Yes** — this feels right. I want to commit and learn it properly.”
  - [ ]  “**No** — this isn’t for me, and that’s okay.”
*Choose one that matters most and be honest with yourself. Ignore hype and salary — ask whether you would genuinely enjoy doing this work every week.*

## 🏗️ **Foundations** <sub>*.. the building blocks*</sub>
We’re building your expertise from the ground up so that working with code and data feels like a second language. The goal is to move beyond <i>rushing through tutorials</i> and instead focus on <b>genuine effort and deep understanding</b> so that working with data and code feels natural.

    Mastery is not a function of genius or talent, it is a function of time and intense focus.

## 🎯 **SUPERNOVA - Capstone Project** <sub>*.. the end* </sub>

<details>
<summary>This is where learning stops being theoretical. Projects are how you turn concepts, tools, and code into <b>real understanding</b>.</summary>

| Level | Project |
|-------|--------|
| Beginner | API → Warehouse pipeline |
| Intermediate | Airflow + dbt project |
| Advanced | Kafka + CDC streaming |
| Expert | Full Medallion data platform |


**One solid project is enough** if it’s done properly.
1. **Extraction:** Scrape a public API using **Python** (e.g., Weather or Finance data).
2. **Containerization:** Wrap your scraper in a **Docker** container.
3. **Storage:** Land the raw data in a **Cloud Bucket** (S3/GCS) in **JSON** format.
4. **Transformation:** Use **SQL** or **Spark** to clean the data and convert it to **Parquet**.
5. **Modeling:** Load it into a **Lakehouse** using a Star Schema.
6. **Orchestration:** Schedule the whole flow using **Airflow**.
7. **Reliability:** Implement **Data Quality** checks (e.g., Great Expectations) and **Logging**.

## 💼 **Interview Prep** <sub>*.. prepare and get hired* </sub>

<details>
<summary>At this point, you won’t know 100% of data engineering, and that’s completely normal. The good news is you already have around 70% of the skills needed to start applying. There’s no reason to wait anymore. Now it’s time to prepare yourself, put your profile together, and start applying for jobs.</summary>
